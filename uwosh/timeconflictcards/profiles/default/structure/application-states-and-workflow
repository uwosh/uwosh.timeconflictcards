<ul>
<li>Student fills out a request</li>
<li>Student submits the request</li>
<li>Instructor #1 reviews the request, and can:</li>
<ul>
<li>deny it (don't forget to put a reason for the denial in the comments dropdown)</li>
<li>approve it (sending it on to Instructor #2)</li>
<li>add a comment then request a response from the student (in which case the student must add a comment then mark that he/she has responded)</li>
</ul>
<li>Instructor #2 reviews the request, and can:</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>deny it (don't forget to put a reason for the denial in the comments dropdown)</li>
<li>approve it (sending it on to the Registrar's Office)</li>
<li>add a comment then request a response from the student (in which case the student must add a comment then mark that he/she has responded) </li>
